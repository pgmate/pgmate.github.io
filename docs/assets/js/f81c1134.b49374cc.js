This is true for both technical and personal growth.\\n\\nBy embedding [Community-driven Articles](https://github.com/pgmate/contents/tree/main/contents/articles) into a development tool (that I hope you use daily) chances are that some articles will catch your attention and you will read through. \ud83e\udd1e\\n\\n## The Journey Ahead\\n\\nMy brain is exploding with ideas how to take the educational side of PGMate to the next level:\\n\\n### Bookmarks\\n\\nSame as for the quick-facts, it will be possible to \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e an article, influencing its display status and building a short-list of content that is particularly relevant for you.\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\nPGMate aims to be a social platform focused on databases and Postgres.\\n\\nOne possibile development is to introduce an account system and link it to your running client (yeah, just another token) and enable classic community features such as comments and similar.\\n\\nAnother direction would be to enable multi-account within an installation and run this comments feature among the users that can access one PGMate instace. Highly inspired by the concept of a Discord server.\\n\\n### Annotations\\n\\nI plan to steal this feature from Kindle. I just love to highlight and annotate contents there, and collect my ideas and reflections in an automatic scrapebook.\\n\\nWouldn\'t it be nice?\\n\\nYour local PGMate instance will then become a mix of client, editor, and notebook.\\n\\n### Personal Articles\\n\\nThe community articles are basically just a bookmark file on GitHub that is automatically imported when your client boots.\\n\\nWell, why not add a \\"+\\" icon and let the user add custom bookmarks as well?\\n\\nOf course, we would prefer if you decide share your bookmarks with the community and [open a new PR towards our Contents Repository](https://github.com/pgmate/contents).\\n\\n### Community-driven Courses\\n\\nThe Internet is full of good training material. For free.\\n\\nArticles, videos, podcasts. The content is out there but needs research and organization.\\n\\nThe idea is to build catalogs of structured contents that fulfill a learning purpose.\\n\\nThis will be similar to how the Articles work, but the _\\"bookmark file\\"_ would be organized by goals and milestones.\\n\\nHere are some examples of a possible structure:\\n\\n- Goal: Postgres Intro\\n  - Milestone 1: Run Postgres using Docker\\n  - Milestone 2: Basic CRUD\\n  - ...\\n- Goal: Indexing\\n  - Milestone 1: Theory on Indexes\\n  - Milestone 2: Explain / Analyze\\n  - ...\\n\\nEach milestone will be a list of **bookmarks to free online materials** (I guess mostly YouTube videos) that are sorted out from easy to difficult and are meant to be consumed in order.\\n\\nOf course, all of this will be JSON files in out [Contents Repository](https://github.com/pgmate/contents) that you and everyone else can edit and PR to. The idea is to build this organized content togegher, right?\\n\\nPGMate will import the sources into the local state at boot time and provide a nice UI where you can look around the courses catalog, track progress and maybe enjoy the same features that we are imagining for the Articles (bookmarks, annotations, comments)"},{"id":"updates-week5","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/updates-week5","editUrl":"https://github.com/pgmate/pgmate.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025-02-01-updates.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-01-updates.mdx","title":"Product Updates - Week 5","description":"- Create new database and schema","date":"2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"PGMate","permalink":"/blog/tags/pgmate","description":"PGMate Product News"},{"inline":false,"label":"Demo","permalink":"/blog/tags/demo","description":"Demos of the product"}],"readingTime":3.505,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Pegoraro","title":"founder","url":"https://marcopeg.com","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/marcopeg"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/thepeg","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcopeg/","github":"https://github.com/marcopeg","newsletter":"https://marcopeg.com"},"imageURL":"https://marcopeg.com/content/images/2021/11/image-50.png","key":"marcopeg"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"updates-week5","title":"Product Updates - Week 5","authors":["marcopeg"],"tags":["pgmate","demo"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing Community Articles","permalink":"/blog/updates-week7"},"nextItem":{"title":"PGMate Copilot POC","permalink":"/blog/copilot-poc"}},"content":"- Create new database and schema\\n- Tables dependency tree\\n- Edit in SQL studio shortcut\\n- Support Instagres.com\\n- UI niceties\\n  - Resizeable menu\\n  - Arc-inspired main menu\\n  - Dense view on data-grids\\n  - Fixed scroll & sticky page titles\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf89 New Features\\n\\n### Create new Database / Schema\\n\\nIt\'s a little feature, but it could be useful to quickly create a new DB or Schema without having to hit on SQL code.\\n\\nI\'ve taken care of adding an **optional description field** that materializes as a `COMMENT ON` db/schema.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 [Adding comments to your database object will make Copilot much more efficient](https://marcopeg.com/context-fuels-language-models/).\\n\\n![Create new database and schema](/img/updates/w5/create-db-schema.gif)\\n\\n### Table\'s Upstream/Downstram Chart\\n\\nThis is the first step into visualizing the database relations. So far, PGMate uses _foreign keys_ metadata, as long with other information from `pg_depend` about indexes and series.\\n\\nIt is already possible to click on the nodes to navigate the database, and in the future I plan do add _AI-based analysis_ to suggest semantic relations that are not described as part of the schema.\\n\\n![Table\'s Upstream/downswtram charts - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/upstream-downstream.png)\\n\\n### Edit in SQL Studio\\n\\nOne of the goals of PGMate is to expose the generated SQL everywhere in the user interface (\ud83d\udea7) so that the user can learn something from it. If anything, it vastly uses the Postgres\' metadata schemas to do its job.\\n\\nBut there are many situations in which it would be nice to take the generated code and tweak it to get the results you want. Well, now you can.\\n\\n![Edit in SQL Studio - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/edit-in-sql-studio.gif)\\n\\n### Support Instagres Databases\\n\\nI\'ve recently came across [Instagres](https://www.instagres.com/), a service from [Neon](https://neon.tech) that lets you spin up a **temporary Postgres db** in seconds.\\n\\nI tried it, only to figure our that PGMate\'s SSL options weren\'t enough... So now it\'s fixed and you can pass any of the querystring supported options.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 Try to [CREATE an Instagres](https://www.instagres.com/new) db and navigate it with PGMate!\\n\\n![Support Instagres](/img/updates/w5/instagres.gif)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb UX Improvements\\n\\n### Resizeable Side menu\\n\\nOk, not really a game changer, but I was bothered by other Apps that could do this.\\n\\nAnd yes, thanks for asking, I\'m considering a collapsible menu but I\'m not yet sure about its UX yet.\\n\\n![Resizeable Side Menu - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/resize-menu.gif)\\n\\n### Arc Inspired Menu\\n\\nI love the [Arc browser](https://arc.net/), especially how they designed the pinned links in the sidebar.\\n\\nThis is the first step into a similar feature. It\'s only UI for some static links right now, but in the future the idea is to host drag\'n\'droppable bookmarks to tables, functions, snippets and whatsoever.\\n\\n![Arc Inspired Menu - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/arc-inspired-menu.png)\\n\\n### Dense Grid Layout\\n\\nA colleague made a little remark about content density in the results grid... and this turned out to be just a low-hanging fruit (`density=compact` in MUI\'s x-grid).\\n\\n![Dense Grid Layout - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/dense-grid-layout.png)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udea7 COMING UP NEXT\\n\\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\\n\\nI plan to work on **keyboard shortcuts** to navigate the database.\\n\\nFocusing on high-level features:\\n\\n- Home\\n- Copilot\\n- SQL Studio\\n\\nJumping to different layers:\\n\\n- connection\\n- database\\n- schema\\n\\nMoving across table\'s view:\\n\\n- data\\n- info\\n- structure\\n- DDL\\n\\nIn the end, I envision to bring into PGMate something similar to VSCode\'s Command Palette, which I consider one of the best approach to a hybrid or aided keyboard shortcuts management.\\n\\n### Home Screen Articles\\n\\nAs you know, one of the goals of PGMate is to blend a Postgres client with a learning tool or learning experience.\\n\\nThe first micro-step was the **Postgres Facts** feature:\\n\\n![Postgres Facts - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/postgres-facts.gif)\\n\\nThe next step is to curate a blog of open source contents from external sources and inject it into PGMate\'s home screen. This feature is much inspired by [GhostJS](https://ghost.org/) admin panel, and it will be a blend of:\\n\\n- product updates (well, this kind of posts)\\n- Youtube videos\\n- Interesting Reddit conversations\\n- General articles\\n\\nThe idea is to use [PGMate\'s content repo](https://github.com/pgmate/contents/tree/main) to store index files that will be edited and enriched by the community with public PRs. A background function will pull new content into some internal tables that are then used to serve it in an internal category based wall of content."},{"id":"copilot-poc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/copilot-poc","editUrl":"https://github.com/pgmate/pgmate.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025-01-26-copilot-poc.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-26-copilot-poc.mdx","title":"PGMate Copilot POC","description":"Copilot brings real-time context-aware AI to PGMate.","date":"2025-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"PGMate","permalink":"/blog/tags/pgmate","description":"PGMate Product News"},{"inline":false,"label":"Demo","permalink":"/blog/tags/demo","description":"Demos of the product"}],"readingTime":1.915,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Pegoraro","title":"founder","url":"https://marcopeg.com","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/marcopeg"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/thepeg","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcopeg/","github":"https://github.com/marcopeg","newsletter":"https://marcopeg.com"},"imageURL":"https://marcopeg.com/content/images/2021/11/image-50.png","key":"marcopeg"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"copilot-poc","title":"PGMate Copilot POC","authors":["marcopeg"],"tags":["pgmate","demo"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Product Updates - Week 5","permalink":"/blog/updates-week5"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome PGMate","permalink":"/blog/welcome-pgmate"}},"content":"Copilot brings real-time context-aware AI to PGMate.  \\nIt enables the **chat with your data** scenario with in-line code-blocks execution.\\n\\n<YouTube videoId=\\"hAvWcbox7BE\\" title=\\"PGMate Copilot Demo\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThere is a lot of fuzz around the **CHAT WITH YOUR DATA** eldorado.\\n\\nAfter reading an article about [QueryGPT at Uber](https://www.uber.com/en-TW/blog/query-gpt/)\\nI found myself thinking: _\\"How hard could that be?\\"_ \ud83e\udd13  \\nSo I\'ve decided to give it a go.\\n\\nThis demo showcases what is already available to all users that [pull the PGMate image from DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgmate/pgmate).\\n\\n## Setup:\\n\\nYou simply have to provide an [OpenAI Api Key](https://community.openai.com/t/how-to-generate-openai-api-key/401363) as environment variable and you are good to go:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run \\\\\\n    -p 8080:8080 \\\\\\n    -e PGMATE_OPENAPI_KEY=xxx \\\\\\n    pgmate/pgmate:latest-full\\n```\\n\\n## Postgres LLM Context\\n\\nFor this first POC, Copilot uses a **one shot prompt** approach to try solving the user\'s request.\\n\\nWhat makes it working so well is the real-time context that is injected into the conversation.\\n\\nI\'m having a lot of brainstorms about how to **optimize this context for accuracy and economical convenience**.\\n\\n\ud83e\udd13 Because that\'s the real challange.\\n\\nAny fool can copy/paste the full context into ChatGPT and let it crunch by a powerful model.\\nBut this could end up being very costly, and also may lead to inaccuracies.\\nImagine overflowing the model with tens of tables metadata when the business request is only affecting 2 of those.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 Too much information is both useless and harmful.\\n\\n## Plans for the Future\\n\\n**For the engine**, the goal is to move to a multi-step agenting oriented approach:\\n\\n1.
