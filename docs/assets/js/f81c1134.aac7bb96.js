So far, PGMate uses _foreign keys_ metadata, as long with other information from `pg_depend` about indexes and series.\\n\\nIt is already possible to click on the nodes to navigate the database, and in the future I plan do add _AI-based analysis_ to suggest semantic relations that are not described as part of the schema.\\n\\n![Table\'s Upstream/downswtram charts - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/upstream-downstream.png)\\n\\n### Edit in SQL Studio\\n\\nOne of the goals of PGMate is to expose the generated SQL everywhere in the user interface (\ud83d\udea7) so that the user can learn something from it. If anything, it vastly uses the Postgres\' metadata schemas to do its job.\\n\\nBut there are many situations in which it would be nice to take the generated code and tweak it to get the results you want. Well, now you can.\\n\\n![Edit in SQL Studio - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/edit-in-sql-studio.gif)\\n\\n### Support Instagres Databases\\n\\nI\'ve recently came across [Instagres](https://www.instagres.com/), a service from [Neon](https://neon.tech) that lets you spin up a **temporary Postgres db** in seconds.\\n\\nI tried it, only to figure our that PGMate\'s SSL options weren\'t enough... So now it\'s fixed and you can pass any of the querystring supported options.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 Try to [CREATE an Instagres](https://www.instagres.com/new) db and navigate it with PGMate!\\n\\n![Support Instagres](/img/updates/w5/instagres.gif)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb UX Improvements\\n\\n### Resizeable Side menu\\n\\nOk, not really a game changer, but I was bothered by other Apps that could do this.\\n\\nAnd yes, thanks for asking, I\'m considering a collapsible menu but I\'m not yet sure about its UX yet.\\n\\n![Resizeable Side Menu - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/resize-menu.gif)\\n\\n### Arc Inspired Menu\\n\\nI love the [Arc browser](https://arc.net/), especially how they designed the pinned links in the sidebar.\\n\\nThis is the first step into a similar feature. It\'s only UI for some static links right now, but in the future the idea is to host drag\'n\'droppable bookmarks to tables, functions, snippets and whatsoever.\\n\\n![Arc Inspired Menu - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/arc-inspired-menu.png)\\n\\n### Dense Grid Layout\\n\\nA colleague made a little remark about content density in the results grid... and this turned out to be just a low-hanging fruit (`density=compact` in MUI\'s x-grid).\\n\\n![Dense Grid Layout - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/dense-grid-layout.png)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udea7 COMING UP NEXT\\n\\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\\n\\nI plan to work on **keyboard shortcuts** to navigate the database.\\n\\nFocusing on high-level features:\\n\\n- Home\\n- Copilot\\n- SQL Studio\\n\\nJumping to different layers:\\n\\n- connection\\n- database\\n- schema\\n\\nMoving across table\'s view:\\n\\n- data\\n- info\\n- structure\\n- DDL\\n\\nIn the end, I envision to bring into PGMate something similar to VSCode\'s Command Palette, which I consider one of the best approach to a hybrid or aided keyboard shortcuts management.\\n\\n### Home Screen Articles\\n\\nAs you know, one of the goals of PGMate is to blend a Postgres client with a learning tool or learning experience.\\n\\nThe first micro-step was the **Postgres Facts** feature:\\n\\n![Postgres Facts - PGMate](/img/updates/w5/postgres-facts.gif)\\n\\nThe next step is to curate a blog of open source contents from external sources and inject it into PGMate\'s home screen. This feature is much inspired by [GhostJS](https://ghost.org/) admin panel, and it will be a blend of:\\n\\n- product updates (well, this kind of posts)\\n- Youtube videos\\n- Interesting Reddit conversations\\n- General articles\\n\\nThe idea is to use [PGMate\'s content repo](https://github.com/pgmate/contents/tree/main) to store index files that will be edited and enriched by the community with public PRs. A background function will pull new content into some internal tables that are then used to serve it in an internal category based wall of content."},{"id":"copilot-poc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/copilot-poc","editUrl":"https://github.com/pgmate/pgmate.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025-01-26-copilot-poc.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-26-copilot-poc.mdx","title":"PGMate Copilot POC","description":"Copilot brings real-time context-aware AI to PGMate.","date":"2025-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"PGMate","permalink":"/blog/tags/pgmate","description":"PGMate Product News"},{"inline":false,"label":"Demo","permalink":"/blog/tags/demo","description":"Demos of the product"}],"readingTime":1.915,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Pegoraro","title":"founder","url":"https://marcopeg.com","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/marcopeg"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/thepeg","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcopeg/","github":"https://github.com/marcopeg","newsletter":"https://marcopeg.com"},"imageURL":"https://marcopeg.com/content/images/2021/11/image-50.png","key":"marcopeg"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"copilot-poc","title":"PGMate Copilot POC","authors":["marcopeg"],"tags":["pgmate","demo"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Product Updates - Week 5","permalink":"/blog/updates-week5"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome PGMate","permalink":"/blog/welcome-pgmate"}},"content":"Copilot brings real-time context-aware AI to PGMate.  \\nIt enables the **chat with your data** scenario with in-line code-blocks execution.\\n\\n<YouTube videoId=\\"hAvWcbox7BE\\" title=\\"PGMate Copilot Demo\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThere is a lot of fuzz around the **CHAT WITH YOUR DATA** eldorado.\\n\\nAfter reading an article about [QueryGPT at Uber](https://www.uber.com/en-TW/blog/query-gpt/)\\nI found myself thinking: _\\"How hard could that be?\\"_ \ud83e\udd13  \\nSo I\'ve decided to give it a go.\\n\\nThis demo showcases what is already available to all users that [pull the PGMate image from DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgmate/pgmate).\\n\\n## Setup:\\n\\nYou simply have to provide an [OpenAI Api Key](https://community.openai.com/t/how-to-generate-openai-api-key/401363) as environment variable and you are good to go:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run \\\\\\n    -p 8080:8080 \\\\\\n    -e PGMATE_OPENAPI_KEY=xxx \\\\\\n    pgmate/pgmate:latest-full\\n```\\n\\n## Postgres LLM Context\\n\\nFor this first POC, Copilot uses a **one shot prompt** approach to try solving the user\'s request.\\n\\nWhat makes it working so well is the real-time context that is injected into the conversation.\\n\\nI\'m having a lot of brainstorms about how to **optimize this context for accuracy and economical convenience**.\\n\\n\ud83e\udd13 Because that\'s the real challange.\\n\\nAny fool can copy/paste the full context into ChatGPT and let it crunch by a powerful model.\\nBut this could end up being very costly, and also may lead to inaccuracies.\\nImagine overflowing the model with tens of tables metadata when the business request is only affecting 2 of those.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 Too much information is both useless and harmful.\\n\\n## Plans for the Future\\n\\n**For the engine**, the goal is to move to a multi-step agenting oriented approach:\\n\\n1.
