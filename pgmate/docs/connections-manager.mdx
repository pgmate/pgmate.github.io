# 👩‍💻 Connections Manager

PGMate lets you store multiple connections data in a secure way (it's encrypted, and only you manage the key).

## Add Connections

The easiest way to add a new connection is by providing a qualified connection string such as:

```bash
postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
```

And you can quickly create a new (temporary) database and try this out using [Instagres.com](https://instagres.com/new):

## Switching Connections

The Connection Switcher -- top/right corner of the user interface -- let you quickly jump between different connections, opening the default database's dashboard view:
