## In Your Development Machine

### Standalone Container

This command will run the experimental standalone container that ships both PGMate and a Postgres 16 server within the same container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 pgmate/pgmate:latest-full
```

:::info
This is the minimal config option and works well in any OS that supports Docker.  
_Yes, also Windows._
:::

### Quick Bash

1. open your favourite Terminal App
2. paste this command

```bash
curl -sL https://bit.ly/3ZAx19E | bash -s -- run
```

:::info
You need [Docker](https://docker.com) and a Linux environment (Mac also works fine)
:::

### Clone the Demo Project

1. open your favourite Terminal App
2. `git clone https://github.com/pgmate/demo pgmate`
3. `cd pgmate`
4. `docker compose up`

:::info
You need [Docker](https://docker.com) and a Linux environment (Mac also works fine)
:::

## Login

The [Demo Project](https://github.com/pgmate/demo) ships with `pgmate` as default password:

![PGMate Login](https://github.com/pgmate/demo/raw/main/pgmate-login.png)

:::info
You can change it to your favourite password by editing `PGMATE_ADMIN_SECRET` env variable.

üßë‚Äçüíª If you are running if from the _QuickBash_ command, try:

```bash
curl -sL https://bit.ly/3ZAx19E | bash -s \
  -- run \
  --secret=foobar
```
:::

## Connections Manger

PGMate lets you define multiple connections:

![List available connections](https://github.com/pgmate/demo/raw/main/connections-manager-list.png)

PGMate requires a default connection string provided as environmental variable `PGSTRING=postgres://postgres:xxx@postgres:5432/postgres`.

The [Demo Project](https://github.com/pgmate/demo) ships with a local Postgres container running alongside PGMate.

üëâ The `default` connection is hidden in the _Connections Manager_ and can not be modified via UI.

:::info
You can change the default db by editing the `PGSTRING` env variable

üßë‚Äçüíª If you are running if from the _QuickBash_ command, try:

```bash
curl -sL https://bit.ly/3ZAx19E | bash -s \
  -- run \
  --pgstring=postgres://....
```
:::

:::warning

All the connections that you add are stored in the default db and **ARE ENCRYPTED WITH A DEFAULT KEY**.  
üíª _This is ok for local instances, but it should always be seriously evaluated._

üå©Ô∏è If you are running PGMate in a shared instance, we recommend you to implement the `PGMATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environmental variable with a custom encryption key that you can easily generate:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
